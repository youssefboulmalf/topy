                  Think of the Ngorongoro Crater as hyper-condensed action, like
                  bringing all the best in safari to boil. Here everything
                  bubbles closer, tighter, and louder. Peer inside this
                  primordial caldera and what you see is a petri dish density of
                  wildlife, more predator-prey interactions per capita than
                  almost anywhere on the planet.

            The Ngorongoro Crater is a breathtakingly beautiful setting and the
            best place in East Africa to see the Big Five. It is a great way to
            start your African safari adventure. However, as one of the world’s
            most astonishing and renowned natural wonders, the Ngorongoro Crater
            does get busy, and at times very busy. Due to the crowds we
            recommend a two-night stay only here, then moving on to the
            Serengeti for a quieter, more private safari experience.

            Any Northern Tanzania Safari should ideally include a visit to
            Ngorongoro Crater: it is one of the most beautiful natural wildlife
            safari sites in the world and an exceptional place to interact with
            people from the Maasai tribe.<br/><br/> The Ngorongoro Crater and surrounding
            highlands together form one of Africa’s most beautiful regions.
            Volcanic craters form stunning backdrops to some of the most fertile
            and richest grazing grounds in Africa. The most famous such crater
            is without question Ngorongoro, the world’s largest intact volcanic
            caldera and home to the highest density of big game in Africa.
            Ngorongoro is justifiably one of the continent’s most famous safari
            destinations.

          <h3>How to get to the Ngorongoro Crater | Arusha to Ngorongoro</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Driving from Arusha. Depending on your party size, it may be cheaper
            for you to all share a private vehicle and guide from when you are
            picked up from your international flight at Kilimanjaro Airport all
            the way until you fly out of the Ngorongoro region. If you are
            driving, it is essential to have a night either side of your crater
            descent either in a camp on the crater rim, or a 20 minute drive
            away in the Ngorongoro Highlands. This means you can get to the
            gates early to avoid the crowds! <br/><br/><br/>Flying from Arusha. If you are
            staying at a “fly in” camp which means your guide and vehicle are
            provided by your camp, and not by a ground handler from Arusha, you
            can fly into Lake Manyara airstrip, and get picked up by the camp.
            This can be a good idea if there are less people in your party,
            making flying cheaper than driving in a private vehicle from Arusha.
            It is also essential for some camps which are usually the more
            luxurious ones.

          <h3>Where is the Serengeti?</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            The Serengeti is the main component of a Northern Tanzania Safari
            Itinerary. It is a vast stretch of endless plains brimming with
            wildlife in the North East of Tanzania – Tanzania’s border changes
            it to Kenya’s famous Masai Mara. It is only a short flight from
            Arusha (along with many other Northern airstrips!) – a flight you
            absolutely must consider if you are ever visiting other Northern
            Tanzania parks. Many travellers also visit Northern Tanzania to
            experience the vibrant Maasai culture in the Ngorongoro Highlands,
            but also to go into the Ngorongoro Crater itself. There are also
            other smaller surrounding parks, Lake Manyara and Tarangire, but
            these are more “add on” destinations – The Serengeti in our view is
            the real star of the show.

          <h3>Ngorongoro Crater Weather – When to go</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Since the wildlife mainly stays in the crater all year round, there
            is really no good or bad time to visit. However given that the
            crater floor does get busy with vehicles, it can be more pleasant to
            visit during low season. Higher water levels in Lake Magadi (in the
            centre of the Crater) also result in higher concentrations of
            flamingos. Whenever you visit to Ngorongoro, you are guaranteed
            excellent safari action. The beauty of an Ngorongoro safari is
            because of its unique micro-climate, it can be enjoyed year round.

          <h3>How did the Ngorongoro Crater form?</h3>
          <p>
            Now classed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Ngorongoro Crater
            was formed when a giant volcano exploded and collapsed around 3
            million years ago. The cone of the volcanic caldera collapsed
            inwards and created what we know today as one of the most unique
            safari parks in Africa, and indeed the world. A one of a kind safari
            destination teeming with life.<br/><br/> Now Ngorongoro is a notoriously
            difficult destination to work out logistics for, but from years of
            experience organizing such trips, we can guide you in the right
            direction – so give us a call to discuss your different options.
