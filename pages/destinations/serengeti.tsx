                <h2>
                  At 14,763 square kilometres in size, the Serengeti is arguably
                  the finest national park in Africa and offers a wealth of
                  wildlife viewing opportunities. Pretty much every large animal
                  in East Africa can be regularly seen in the national park or
                  wider ecosystem.

            The Serengeti National Park is Africa’s most famous. Renowned for
            its incredible concentrations of predators and the Great Migration
            of two million grazers, a safari here is guaranteed to be
            exceptional. The endless grassy plains are amongst the richest
            grazing grounds in the African bush, and therefore home to the
            largest herds and the highest concentrations of predators on the
            planet.

            The Serengeti Africa is one of those very rare places that has a
            huge reputation, yet still somehow manages to surpass expectations
            and take your breath away. Surrounded by remarkable tribes such as
            the Massai and Hadzabe, this wider area is also fascinating from a
            cultural perspective. The whole park is a world heritage site, and
            the varied eco-system coupled with the huge volume of wildlife means
            you can spend ample time in different locations and never feel like
            you’ve seen it all. From the dramatic Kjopes in the north, to the
            acacia dotted endless plains to the south, it is not just the
            animals which makes a safari in the Serengeti so remarkable. In a
            nutshell, it is rightly the most celebrated wildlife reserves in the
            world; there is nowhere else to match it. It is outstanding!

          <h3>Serengeti National Park | The Wildlife</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            There is such a variety of species to be found in the Serengeti and
            definitely too great a number to mention here, which is why it is
            such an integral part of a Tanzania safari. The park’s main
            attraction is the Great Migration, consisting of up to 2 million
            wildebeest, 200,000 zebras and 350,000 thompson, impala and grant’s
            gazelles – many consider it to be the most spectacular remaining
            African wildlife spectacle. The predator viewing here is exceptional
            with approximately 3-4,000 lion and huge numbers of cheetah, leopard
            and hyena. Other animals commonly found in the park include topi,
            eland, hartebeest, buffalo, elephant, caracal, serval, bat-eared
            fox, hyrax, genet, hares, porcupine, aardvark, giraffe, jackal,
            mongoose, crocodile, monitor lizard, aardwolf, many kinds of
            primates including baboons, vervet and colobus monkeys, and over 500
            species of bird.

          <h3>Where is the Serengeti?</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            The Serengeti is the main component of a Northern Tanzania Safari
            Itinerary. It is a vast stretch of endless plains brimming with
            wildlife in the North East of Tanzania – Tanzania’s border changes
            it to Kenya’s famous Masai Mara. It is only a short flight from
            Arusha (along with many other Northern airstrips!) – a flight you
            absolutely must consider if you are ever visiting other Northern
            Tanzania parks. Many travellers also visit Northern Tanzania to
            experience the vibrant Maasai culture in the Ngorongoro Highlands,
            but also to go into the Ngorongoro Crater itself. There are also
            other smaller surrounding parks, Lake Manyara and Tarangire, but
            these are more “add on” destinations – The Serengeti in our view is
            the real star of the show.

          <h3>When to go to the Serengeti National Park</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            To focus solely on the Great Migration would be to do this park a
            grave injustice. Even taking the Great Migration out of the
            equation, it can be argued that the Serengeti is still the finest
            park in Africa. Vast herds of grazers, huge prides of lion,
            spectacular expanses of uninterrupted views, wildebeest river
            crossings, great leopard sightings, fantastic vast cheetah inhabited
            plains and some of the best camps in Africa – as such, it is an
            incredible safari destination year-round.

            Serengeti Migration | When is the Great Migration in the Serengeti?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Wildebeest Migration is often thought to be the star of the show
            on a Tanzania holiday. Contrary to popular misconceptions, the herds
            can be seen in the Serengeti all year round. There are some better
            months to visit to get the full impact of the sheer size of the
            herds such as in July – October when they are crossing the mighty
            Mara River in Northern Serengeti, or in February when they all
            congregate for calving season in the southern Ndutu plains.
