              <h1>Zanzibar</h1>
              <h2>
                Known as the Spice Island, the beautiful island of Zanzibar on
                Africa’s east coast is bursting with culture and history,
                seemingly at odds with its idyllic geography of white-sand
                beaches with palms swaying lazily in the sea breeze. Together
                this makes Zanzibar a fabulous place to explore as well as a
                dream to relax and unwind.

            The Zanzibar archipelago is one of the most historic Indian Ocean
            islands, awash with atmosphere, intrigue, and idyllic beach
            experiences. There are masses of accommodation options across the
            price spectrum, and plenty to see, do and discover. As the
            birthplace of the Swahili, site of Sultans’ Palaces and renowned for
            its spice plantations, the little island republic of Zanzibar
            features larger-than-life on the world map and is a must-see at the
            end of any African trip, but is especially great when added onto a
            Tanzanian safari
          </span>
          <p>
            There are some fabulous beaches on the islands of Zanzibar, and many
            choices for an ideal spot to sit back and watch the white dhow sails
            cruising the startling blue waters of the Indian Ocean. Whether it
            is for a Zanzibar holiday, honeymoon or some post-safari relaxation;
            whether you prefer the blissful privacy of a private island or the
            amenities of a larger hotel; and whatever your preferred activities,
            there are good options for every traveller.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have made our information on Zanzibar as comprehensive as
            possible, but the best way to get to grips with the islands is to
            give us a call and chat through your plans. Although the information
            is all here, our team of experts have been organising holidays to
            Zanzibar for 20 years and are constantly returning to see what’s
            changed, so our first-hand knowledge coupled with an understanding
            of your expectations is by far the best way to narrow down your
            options!

              particularly good for those who are really keen
            </li>{" "}
            <li>
              Diving –Diving trips can be organised from all the hotels we love
              to recommend. Again, Pemba Island offers some of the best diving
              in the world. Mafia Island diving is also exceptional with the
              mighty whale sharks in abundance here from October – March.

          <h3>Where is Zanzibar?</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Zanzibar is conveniently located on the shores of Tanzania and
            exceptionally well placed to bookend a safari of a lifetime. With so
            much on offer here accommodation and activity wise, Zanzibar has
            something for even the most selective of travellers. The vast and
            wild Selous Game Reserve is a mere 45 minute flight away. As you can
            see, with a Tanzania beach and safari holiday, nothing so luxurious
            could be easier.
          </p>
          <h3>Getting to Zanzibar</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Zanzibar is only a short 20 minute flight from Dar es Salaam
            international which is the landing point for flights from all over
            the world. You cannot directly fly to Dar es Salaam from London or
            the US, but many airlines (KLM, Emirates) have two stop flights
            which make the travel fairly easy (usually via Amsterdam and Dubai).
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Zanzibar Africa weather</h3>
          <p>
            November: Short rains. Not advisable if wanting consistent sunshine,
            but good value.
            <br />
            <br /> December – February: A good time to go.
            <br /> <br /> March: A bit hit and miss weather-wise, but a good
            time for hotels at a reduced rate.
            <br /> <br /> April – May: Not advisable to travel in these months.
            Heavy rains expected.
            <br /> <br /> June: A bit hit and miss weather-wise, but a good time
            for reduced rates.
            <br /> <br /> July – October: Prime Zanzibar travel season. Good
            weather and amazing nearby safaris (Selous and Ruaha)
          </p>
          <h3>Zanzibar tourism: recent years</h3>
          <p>
            Zanzibar is booming as a tourist destination; there is space here
            for backpackers and luxury beach retreaters alike. As a result there
            are a lot of fantastic boutique hotels to choose from. We have
            vetted them all and have our favourites, so give us a call and we
            can give you some recommendations.
          </p>
          <h3>Is Zanzibar safe?</h3>
          <p>
            The general answer is yes! However, as with anywhere, things can
            always change. Please see Government Foreign Travel Advice for up to
            date information and advice.
          </p>
          <h3>Dar to Zanzibar – Safari and Zanzibar Holidays</h3>
          <p>
            After your 20 minute flight to Dar es Salaam, you only have to hop
            over a short 40 minute flight and you are in the beautiful and
            watery Selous Game Reserve. Add another half an hour west, and get
            to the wild and fabulous Ruaha National Park . Northern Tanzania is
            pretty easy too, though flights are rather more expensive – give
            yourself just over an hour in the air though and you can hop from a
            famous Serengeti safari right into Indian Ocean paradise… Quite the
            combination!
          </p>
          <h2 className="section-head">ZANZIBAR | THE AREAS</h2>
          <h3>The best beaches on Zanzibar</h3>
          <p>
            Nungwi and Kendwa (North)– The best beaches on the island. Really
            beautiful and classic Indian Ocean paradise. Non-tidal turquoise
            waters and really powdery white sands. Can sometimes be busy. <br />
            <br />
            Pongwe (East) – Pongwe sits in a little concave bit of coast line
            which means the beach is glorious and when the tide isn’t completely
            in, it is seaweed free and very pretty. Not the long sweeping
            beaches of the north, but a pocket of pure beachy gold. Less busy
            than the north.
            <br />
            <br /> Paje and Dongwe (East) – Although tidal, here sit some of our
            favourite luxury boutique hotels. You would not be let down here in
            terms of accommodation. The beach is beautiful, but getting your
            toes wet is a bit harder than in the northern Nungwi regions as the
            sea is further out and very tidal.
            <br />
            <br /> Matemwe (North-East) – Slightly to the east of Nungwi,
            Matemwe is slightly tidal but when the tide is in there are a few of
            our favourite fantastic value accommodation options.
          </p>
          <h3>Stone Town Zanzibar</h3>
          <p>
            Visitors to Zanzibar tend to arrive and leave via Stone Town, the
            island capital and an historic hub of commerce and culture. This
            ancient centre was the seat of the Sultans, whose crumbling palaces,
            bath houses and mosques are a legacy of this opulent and vibrant
            time at the heart of the gold trade.
            <br />
            <br /> The town has a very different commercial attitude today, and
            one that thrives on the growing tourist market. The labyrinthine
            streets are lined with traders selling everything from mass-produced
            art works to ancient wooden doors, from tie dye t-shirts to jewels.
            The muezzins’ call to prayer echoes across the rooftops at the break
            of day, while cats, goats, dogs, roosters and babies often make
            themselves heard in between! This old town remains a wonderful place
            to spend a night or two, getting lost among the elegant, ancient
            buildings, eating fresh fish on the sea front and breathing in the
            sights, sounds and smells of a truly Swahili centre. A stay in Stone
            Town is always a wondrous assault on the senses, but a couple of
            nights are enough if you value peace and quiet and a good nights
            sleep! Nowadays there are a good number of Boutique hotels in Stone
            Town – often recently renovated.
          </p>
          <h3>The islands off Zanzibar</h3>
          <p>
            Pemba Island– Pemba is truly off the beaten tourist track. It is
            beautiful, culturally rich and with a few top notch hotels which we
            love to recommend. It has some of the best diving in the world in
            pristine coral reefs and for those who love to be active, this is
            your place. The only downside is that the beaches are very tidal –
            so if you are looking for long white sands, you are better off on
            Zanzibar.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mafia Island – Like Pemba, Mafia is relatively new to the tourism
            industry. However, it is home to some great lodges. Many are drawn
            to Mafia for the whale shark diving – an experience not to be
            forgotten. Give yourself 5 days here and you have a fantastic chance
            of seeing these majestic creatures up close.
          </p>
          <h3>The islands off Zanzibar</h3>
          <p>
            Mnemba Island – This private island has only one lodge, Mnemba
            Island Lodge. It is the ultimate Indian Ocean beach destination for
            those who want complete seclusion away from the crowds. Mnemba is
            the ultimate Tanzania honeymoon beach lodge. This tiny island is
            everything you can imagine of a remote windswept paradise and often
            voted one of the most romantic destinations on the planet.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fanjove Private Island – Yes, Mnemba is the ultimate, but for those
            who do not wish to fork out over $1,500 per person per night and
            want a private slice of pure beach heaven, you cannot get better
            than Fanjove. Beach-shack-chic but ideal for those who crave luxury
            in its purest natural form.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanda Island – At around $25,000 a night, it has got to be
            unbelievable. But take a large group and occupy it’s 9 luxury rooms
            and it becomes a (admittedly, only slightly!) more affordable option
            for those who want complete Indian Ocean exclusivity.
