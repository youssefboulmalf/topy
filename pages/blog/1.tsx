            Tanzania. From incredible game reserves teeming with wildlife to
            glorious beaches, luxurious accommodation and incredible culture and

            your next holiday there.
          </span>
          <h3>1. The Great Migration</h3>
          <p>
            Africa is full of amazing wildlife experiences but one of the most
            spectacular to witness is the Great Migration. A once in a lifetime
            experience and on the bucket list of many a traveller to Africa,
            none can surpass this incredible spectacle: a million wildebeest
            crossing the plains of the <Link href={'/destinations/serengeri'}>Serengeti </Link>in search of fresh grass while
            braving predators and perilous river crossings.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>2. Mount Kilimanjaro</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Located in North Eastern Tanzania, Kilimanjaro is the highest
            mountain in Africa and can be seen from far into Kenya. The mountain
            represents a powerful life force for the local Chagga people and all
            those who have made their lives around the mountain, providing rich
            volcanic soils for agriculture and an endless source of pure spring
            waters. 75,000 people climb Kilimanjaro every year so it is not the
            most untouched mountain, nor is it the most arduous, however it is
            still an awe inspiring sight to behold and highly recommended for
            anyone with even a vague interest in mountaineering.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>3.Zanzibar</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            What better way to round off a safari adventure through Tanzania
            than to spend some time relaxing in <Link href={'/destinations/zanzibar'}>Zanzibar</Link> on one of its beautiful
            white sand beaches. Known as the “Spice Island”, <Link href={'/destinations/zanzibar'}>Zanzibar</Link> has
            brought visitors from other lands since time immemorial – Persians,
            Chinese, Arabs, Indians and many more have all sailed their vessels
            into <Link href={'/destinations/zanzibar'}>Zanzibar</Link>’s harbour over the centuries, bent on trade and
            sometimes plunder. Make sure to visit Stone Town to explore its
            spice markets and superb Arabic architecture. If diving is more your
            thing then learn to dive at one of the many dive centres the local
            resorts boast – the waters around the island are very clear and host
            a huge diversity of marine life.
          </p>
          <h3>4. The Food</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Tanzanian cuisine is a mix of traditional African food, with a
            strong Arabic/Indian influence, especially along the coast and in

          </p>{" "}
          <h3>5. Outstanding Accommodation Options</h3>{" "}

            to accommodation. For the ultimate luxury safari experience there is
            the Four Seasons Serengeti, for those looking for an authentic

          </p>{" "}
          <h3>6. The Maasai People</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            The Maasai people of East Africa live in southern Kenya and northern
            Tanzania along the Great Rift Valley on semi-arid and arid lands.
            They’re well known for the special red cloth they wear which is
            called a Shuka and their highly energetic customs. They openly
            welcome visitors to the area to experience their culture and
            lifestyle first hand.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>7. Wildlife and Birdlife</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Tanzania has the largest concentration and diversity of animals in
            Africa and there are over 1000 bird species to spot in the country.
            Tanzania is home to some of the world’s most treasured national
            parks and game reserves including the <Link href={'/destinations/selous'}>Selous Game Reserve</Link>, which is
            the world’s largest game reserve and home to more than 120,000
            elephants, 160,000 buffalos and 2000 rhinos. Selous is also home to
            large concentrations of hippos, crocodiles and wild dogs.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>8. The Ngorongoro Crater</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            A jewel in Tanzania’s crown is the <Link href={'/destinations/ngorongoro'}>Ngorongoro</Link> Crater, the world’s
            largest intact volcanic caldera and haven to a wondrous array of
            animal life which makes the crater a “must do” on any visit to
            Tanzania. The backdrop of the crater walls makes for some stunning
            photographic opportunities as you see the animals wander through the
            grasslands on the crater floor towards the lake.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>9. The Western and Southern Safari Parks</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Southern and western Tanzania are very often overlooked by
            travellers intent on visiting the more well known parks of the
            north, yet these regions are highly regarded among serious
            safari-goers. The southern parks of <Link href={'/destinations/selous'}>Selous</Link> and <Link href={'/destinations/ruaha'}>Ruaha</Link> offer seriously
            good wildlife, plus a wider choice of activities and much better
            value for money than can be found in Northern Tanzania. The remote
            western parks of <Link href={'/destinations/mahale'}>Mahale</Link> and <Link href={'/destinations/mahale'}>Katavi</Link> are expensive and more difficult
            to get to, however they do both offer a unique safari and African
            wilderness experience.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>10. Chimpanzees in Mahale National Park</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            The small and remote Mahale Mountains National Park is found in the
            very West of Tanzania and on the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika.
            Chimpanzee treks are the main draw card here and seeing them in
            their natural habitat is a truly magical experience. When you are
            with the chimps you will be able to observe their very human-like
            behaviour as the younger ones play in the trees and the adults
            observe and squabble amongst themselves.
