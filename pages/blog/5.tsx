              <h1>Top 10 unmissable things to do in Zanzibar</h1>
              <h2>
                Zanzibar is magical: the spice-scented, quintessential Indian
                Ocean idyll. Tropical, turquoise waters lap miles of
                palm-fringed, sandy beaches.

            Whether you’re looking for somewhere to relax after climbing
            Kilimanjaro or just want to hang out in an island paradise, Zanzibar
            Island has a lot to offer!
            <br />
            <br />
            This island is located off the Eastern coast of Africa and it has a
            rich history as a trading outpost and a colony, meaning there are
            many more things to do in Zanzibar besides just hitting the beach.
          </span>
          <h3 className="section-head">1. CHECK OUT STONE TOWN</h3>
          <p>
            People have been living on the island for over 20,000 years, but
            Stone Town is the central point of Zanzibar. Because of its location
            off the coast and its sheltered harbor, Stone Town turned from a
            fishing village into a trading center. The island also was governed
            by many colonial rulers, from Portugal to Oman to Great Britain,
            until it became independent in 1963.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a trading center, the island has plenty of cultural influences
            from colonizers and traders from India and Arab countries. Slavery
            also affected the island as it was used as a port to send slaves
            abroad while hundreds of slaves also worked on plantations on the
            island.
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s a mix of African, Arabic, and colonial styles all packed into
            one city. Because of all the unique influences, Stone Town has
            actually declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000!
            <br />
            <br />
            The best way to get a feel for this city is to wander around the
            narrow maze of streets. You’ll definitely get lost, but that’s half
            the fun!
            <br />
            <br />
            You’ll also probably be able to tell quickly that a lot of things
            haven’t been properly maintained since the colonial era. The older
            facades of the buildings are part of what gives Stone Town its the
            unique charm!
            <br />
            <br />
            Stone Town itself is fairly small with a population of just 16,000
            residents living inside the city in 2016. The town’s economy is now
            primarily based on tourism and it is one of the most prominent
            tourist attractions in Tanzania.
            <br />
            <br />
            FUN FACT: Stone Town is actually one part of Zanzibar City. The
            other area of the city is called Ng’ambo, which is more modern.
            Stone Town is the more historical section. So if you see the two
            names used interchangeably, it’s because Stone Town is part of
            Zanzibar City!
          </p>{" "}
          <h3 className="section-body">Things to do in Stone Town</h3>
          <p>
            Besides just wandering around the streets, there are lots of things
            to do in Stone Town. This is the perfect city to really get a better
            understanding of Zanzibar people and culture.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are a few things I recommend checking out in Stone Town:
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Take a guided walking tour</h3>
          <p>
            Most hotels offer guided day tours around the city and I definitely
            recommend doing the tour with a guide. All the tourists you’ll see
            walking around are led by guides. You will learn so much more
            information with a guide and it’s not that expensive either! I
            definitely recommend it – you won’t regret it! Your guide can also
            tell you about the dark past of the island.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Admire stone town’s intricate doors</h3>
          <p>
            The fascinating architecture of the buildings starts with their
            doors! As you wander through the streets, make sure you look around
            at the beautiful, carved doors that are a special feature of the
            city.
            <br />
            <br />
            The designs and carvings of the doors tell about the residents who
            lived there. You can also tell whether the doors are Swahili,
            Indian, or Arab based on the shape and design!{" "}
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>See the birthplace of freddie mercury</h3>
          <p>
            If you love Queen, don’t miss out on the chance to see where Freddie
            Mercury was born – it is located right in the city center, so you
            won’t miss it! (Or just search Freddie Mercury’s birthplace on
            Google Maps). Some people say this might not be the real house
            (because his father moved several times when Freddie was young), but
            it’s still a great opportunity to learn a little more about the
            background and upbringing of this amazing singer!
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Admire the old fort</h3>
          <p>
            This is exactly what the name says it is! Take a look around a
            unique piece of history and check out The Old Fort. This is an old
            fortification built by the Omani Arabs in 1699. It is also one of
            the oldest buildings in town.
            <br />
            <br />A more recent addition to the fort is an open-air amphitheater
            where you can watch local shows or other events. You can ask at the
            tourist information desk at the fort if there are any upcoming
            events that could fit into your Zanzibar travel plans.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Visit the house of wonders</h3>
          <p>
            This was unfortunately closed for renovation while I was there, but
            I’ll definitely be visiting on my next trip to Zanzibar!
            <br />
            <br />
            This is the tallest and largest building in town and was originally
            a palace facing the town’s central square. The building is now home
            to the National Museum of History and Culture.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Learn about the slave trade at the slave museum</h3>
          <p>
            As I mentioned before, the island has a dark past. This market was
            the last functioning slave market in the world and it only closed in
            1873. Although this might seem like a bit of a downer, it’s an
            important part of the history of the region. Thousands of Africans
            were brought to the island as slaves to work on plantations. Slave
            traders also used the island as a base camp before sending slaves on
            the long journey to the East to be sold in Persia, Arabia, the
            Ottoman Empire, and Egypt.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the Slave Museum, you can tour chambers where they kept slaves
            before they were sold.
            <br />
            <br />
            We went down to see the “rooms” where slaves were kept – a 12 by
            12-foot basement with one tiny window near the ceiling. They kept
            over 30 people in these types of rooms. Although this happened
            hundreds of years ago it still gave me shivers as I stood there!
            <br />
            <br />
            You might need a pick-me-up after, but it’ll help you understand
            more about the island and its people.
            <br />
            <br />
            The museum is open every day from 8 am to 6 pm. There is a $5 USD
            entrance fee and you can expect to spend about an hour in the
            museum.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Visit one of the rooftop restaurants</h3>
          <p>
            After a long day of taking in the sites and the culture, I recommend
            finding a rooftop restaurant for dinner and a drink as the sunsets.
            <br />
            <br />
            I recommend The Tea House Restaurant. It’s a great place to see the
            sunset, but make sure to make a reservation in advance! The
            restaurant gets busy with other tourists who want to enjoy the view
            as well.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another option is The Beach House Restaurant, which has an amazing
            outdoor balcony overlooking the water. The food is a mix of Italian,
            French, and Mediterranean and it’s delicious!
            <br />
            <br />
            You can also check out 6 Degrees South, which is perfect for a
            romantic dinner looking out at the ocean.
          </p>
          <h3>wander around darajani market</h3>
          <p>
            While you’re there, why not wander around the main bazaar in town?
            You’ll definitely get a taste for life in Zanzibar – and a whiff as
            well! I found the market to be a really authentic experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            There is an indoor section of the market, but also a lot of pop-up
            vendors on the surrounding streets. You’ll be able to experience a
            lot of traditional Zanzibar food and ingredients, as well as admire
            clothes, shoes, and traditional hats.
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: Be prepared for the smell since part of this market is a fish
            market!
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Forodhani gardens</h3>
          <p>
            Although I wouldn’t call these actual “gardens,” this is the central
            square of Stone Town. It has lots of trees and is a hotspot for
            locals and tourists alike. I recommend going after sunset and
            enjoying the street food market. To get the full experience, look
            around for the stands that have the longest lines of locals and try
            some authentic Zanzibar dishes here (this means the food is good!).
            <br />
            <br />
            PRO TIP: Locals recommend avoiding the seafood here though – it’s
            not always fresh!
            <br />
            <br />
            PRO TIP 2: As a central spot for tourists, be careful of people
            trying to overcharge you or pretending to be waiters. Some tourists
            have had issues with “waiters” trying to charge them ridiculously
            high prices!
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Drink coffee at jaws corner</h3>
          <p>
            It might take you a while to find it as it’s among the narrow
            streets, but Jaws Corner is a small plaza. You can stop by and try
            the Arabic-style local coffee. Just be prepared – it’s definitely
            not like a cup of coffee with cream and sugar like you might be used
            to! It’s typically served black and bitter, and it is VERY strong.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Do some shopping</h3>
          <p>
            There are so many little boutique stores all over Stone Town.
            There’s a bunch on Ginzenga Street, Kenyatta Road, and Changa Bazaar
            Street. You’ll also be sure to see some great stores for souvenirs
            as you’re wandering around.
            <br />
            <br />
            I wasn’t planning on buying anything, but I loved the jewelry so
            much, I bought myself a pair of earrings! There are excellent places
            there where you can get some Zanzibar souvenirs to bring home!
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: Zanzibar is a predominantly Muslim island. As a female
            traveler visiting Stone Town, you might want to dress
            conservatively.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3 className="section-head">
            2. TAKE A BOAT TRIP AND ENJOY SNORKELING IN ZANZIBAR!
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you want to do a safari in Zanzibar, you can consider a sea
            adventure safari as well! Safari Blue is a company that offers
            full-day tours where you can swim or snorkel. Leaving Stone Town,
            these tours are one of the best ways to experience snorkeling in
            Zanzibar. You might also get a chance to swim with dolphins!
            <br />
            <br />
            Depending on which tour you choose, you will be taken to several
            different places, from a sandbar to a lagoon. You’ll also get a full
            buffet lunch, which is usually grilled right on the beach! You can
            also sail in one of the traditional Dhows (boats used by Arabs and
            Indians that have large triangular sails).
            <br />
            <br />
            There are a bunch of companies that offer similar tours, but Safari
            Blue is the most well-known. It’s also the most expensive and, while
            you can find identical ones for much less, they might not be of the
            same quality.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you’re looking for something more exclusive, you can book your
            own Dhow (at $450 USD for two people) or even charter a private
            yacht! There are plenty of other options to choose from as well,
            depending on your preferences and budget.
            <br />
            <br />
            Also, be sure to book directly through the company, as some places
            charge you extra for the booking!
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: You may have heard of dolphin tours in Zanzibar. These tours
            typically use the boats to scare the dolphins and prevent them from
            leaving an area so that tourists can swim with them. It’s dangerous
            and scary for the animals. Safari Blue doesn’t offer a specific
            “dolphin tour,” so you can see and swim with dolphins if they happen
            to be around where you are, but they don’t scare the animals or do
            anything unethical!
          </p>
          <h3 className="section-head">
            3. TRY SOME LOCAL DISHES – EXPERIENCE AUTHENTIC ZANZIBAR FOOD
          </h3>
          <p>
            You can get these local dishes anywhere on the island if you know
            where to go, but Stone Town might be the easiest place (and most
            authentic!) to try them.
            <br />
            <br />
            For you foodies out there, there are also several food tours you can
            take, in case you don’t want to discover everything by yourself or
            if you are short on time. For example, the 3-hour “Taste of
            Zanzibar” guided tour will bring you to various local stalls and
            restaurants where you can try authentic flavors. You can also do a
            2-hour Afternoon Food Expedition which includes a traditional lunch,
            as well as other samples.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you want to go around the city and try some authentic food by
            yourself, here are some traditional dishes I can recommend:
          </p>
          <h3>Zanzibar pizza</h3>
          <p>
            You might be thinking that you’ve had pizza before, but not like
            this! This isn’t like any pizza you’ve ever seen. It’s more like a
            pancake or pupusa. The dough is folded up so that all the
            ingredients are inside and then it’s cooked on a hot metal pan. You
            can get these with chicken or beef, and they usually also include an
            egg, cheese, onion, bell peppers, and mayo. You can also get it with
            chili if you like spice! If you’re looking for a sweet treat, some
            vendors even make these with Nutella or mango and cheese.
          </p>
          <h3>Biryani and pilau</h3>
          <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            There are two rice dishes that are traditional on the island –
            biryani and pilau.
            <br />
            <br />
            To make biryani, the rice is cooked separately from the meat and
            sauce. Once everything is finished, then everything is combined and
            it’s served with an amazing sauce.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pilau is cooked all together with all the ingredients in the same
            pot, giving the rice an incredible flavor. You can get it either
            with your choice of meat or without any meat. I recommend that you
            try both and see which you like better!
          </p>
          <h3>Urojo Soup</h3>
          <p>
            This is a flour-based soup with mango and lemon flavors. It also
            usually has potatoes served three ways in it – cubed, fried mashed
            potatoes, and potato shavings- along with lots of spices and meat.
            With a slightly sour flavor and a lot of tangs, this soup is
            something you definitely have to try! It’s a lunchtime favorite of
            Zanzibar people.
          </p>
          <h3>Zanzibar tea</h3>
          <p>
            Zanzibar isn’t known as the “spice island” for nothing! When I came
            back from my hike to Kilimanjaro, I was feeling a bit under the
            weather. This tea was a really amazing blend of spices and helped me
            clear my throat!
          </p>
          <h3>Mishkaki (maybe with an octopus!)</h3>
          <p>
            Mishkaki is a meat kabob where the meat is marinated in spices and
            then grilled. These are common snack food and you can get them with
            any kind of meat you like.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you’re feeling adventurous, you can even try them with an
            octopus! The island is known for its “octopus hunters”, so octopus
            is a common addition to lots of dishes.
            <br />
            <br />
            PRO TIP: Be careful where you get these, as some places reheat them
            after they’ve been sitting out. It’s best to watch them grill yours
            so you can see that it’s fresh.
          </p>
          <h3>Mandazi</h3>
          <p>
            Mandazi is a fried dough, a bit similar to a donut, but not as
            sweet. These are eaten alone or with dips and accompany a lot of

          <h3 className="section-body">Learn to Cook Zanzibar Food</h3>
          <p>
            If you completely fall in love with the flavors of Zanzibar, you can
            take a cooking class and learn how to bring the food home with you!
            Most tours will take you out to the market to collect the
            ingredients and then show you how to prepare traditional Zanzibar
            food. You’ll end the day with a full belly and a lot of new
            knowledge! Some classes also include a spice tour so you can do both
            on the same day. Prices start at $41 USD a person.
          </p>
          <h3 className="section-head">4. TAKE A SPICE TOUR IN ZANZIBAR</h3>
          <p>
            Early settlers soon learned that the island was perfect for growing
            a variety of different spices. As a result, there are lots of spice
            farms on the island. You’ll also taste the spices in the food, of
            course!
            <br />
            <br />
            One fun thing to do is to take a spice tour where you can visit a
            spice farm and learn about how they grow and process all the
            different spices.
            <br />
            <br />
            I did a spice tour combined with a town tour of Stone Town. It was a
            long day (and it involved a bit of walking!) so you can consider
            doing them separately, but it’s up to you! Plus, this is also a
            great Zanzibar attraction if you’re traveling with kids.
            <br />
            <br />
            The spice farms are free to visit, but the guides work for tips. You
            can also book a 3-hour tour for $36 USD a person if you want a
            private experience. If you’re short on time and want to see the town
            and a spice farm, the 6-hour Sultan Panorama Tour will show you
            everything you want to see in Stone Town – you’ll visit a spice
            farm, and you’ll get to see a local village!
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: Please note that spice tours are a VERY touristy thing to do.
            The guides will start making your crowns out of palm trees or other
            accessories before you know it. If you’re not a fan of these kinds
            of things, you might be better offer to avoid these tours. On the
            other hand, if you don’t mind something touristy, you’ll actually
            get to learn a lot about spices! We got to see cinnamon, nutmeg,
            black pepper, and cloves.
          </p>
          <h3 className="section-head">5. VISIT JOZANI FOREST</h3>
          <p>
            These monkeys are black and white with red backs and you’ll be sure
            to see a few if you visit the forest. You’ll also see lots of birds
            and unique butterflies, too!
            <br />
            <br />
            The park is open every day from 7:30 am to 5:00 pm. There is an
            entrance fee of $8 USD that includes a brief tour. Then you can
            wander around the mangrove boardwalk on your own. You can tip your
            guide if you like, but it’s not mandatory.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I visited Zanzibar, we had just come back from an amazing
            safari, so we opted out of visiting Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park
            only because we didn’t think there was any chance it could compare
            to our epic safari adventure!
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s best to hit the forest if you’re heading from Stone Town to
            Paje Beach (or the other way around). That way you can stop along
            the way and not make a detour for a quick visit.
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: Tanzania is full of national parks. In fact, 45% of the
            country’s territory is a protected area! But there’s only one on the
            island so you really should visit it if you want the chance to see
            some unique Zanzibar wildlife!
          </p>
          <h3 className="section-head">6. TRY KITESURFING IN ZANZIBAR!</h3>
          If you are searching for some adventurous things to do in Zanzibar –
          try kitesurfing! It’s one of the best spots in the world to do it!
          Kitesurfing is a sport where you ride standing up on a small surfboard
          or kiteboard and let the wind drag you along while you hold onto a
          kite. This is a full-body sport and you’ll definitely be feeling a bit
          sore the next day! Page is considered to be the best place to
          kitesurf, but you can also take lessons at Nungwi beach or Jambiani
          beach. In fact, most tourist beaches offer kitesurfing lessons, so if
          you’re just starting out you can pretty much give it a go anywhere!
          <br />
          <br />
          PRO TIP: The best time to go if you want to kitesurf is from January
          to February or June to September. If you’re there during this time,
          you might also get to see some expert kite surfers doing tricks and
          jumps!
          <br />
          <br />
          There are plenty of different instructors and centers where you can
          learn to kitesurf, so shop around based on where you are and see what
          works for your timeframe and budget. One option is Kite Centre
          Zanzibar, which offers lessons for beginners (all equipment included)
          starting at around $330 USD per person.
          <br />
          <br />
          NOTE: By the way, if you want to check out a place in Zanzibar to
          surf, most kitesurfing places also offer surfing as well.
          <h3 className="section-head">
            7. HEAD TO THE NORTH OF THE ISLAND – NUNGWI BEACH
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most of you are probably already planning on hitting this popular
            beach and, if it’s not on your must-see list, it should be! This is
            the island paradise you’re dreaming of – picture-perfect soft, white
            sand beaches and clear turquoise water.
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: Zanzibar beaches that aren’t part of a hotel or resort aren’t
            really well taken care of and there tends to be a lot of garbage on
            them so don’t waste your time visiting them. Instead, go to the
            beaches that have some infrastructure. If there is at least one
            restaurant nearby, that’s a good indication that the beach around it
            is probably swimmable.
            <br />
            <br />
            Kendwa beach is right around the corner (10 minutes by car) from
            Nungwi Beach. You should check it out too and, while you’re there,
            don’t forget to watch the amazing sunset!

            7. HEAD TO THE NORTH OF THE ISLAND – NUNGWI BEACH
          </h3>
          <p>
            Zanzibar doesn’t have a ton of attractions in the typical sense of
            the word, but The Rock Zanzibar might just be one of them! It is
            something that you’ve probably already seen on postcards as well!
            <br />
            <br />
            This is a unique restaurant that is off the coast of Pingwe, located
            on an actual rock. Depending on the tides, you may have to wade out
            into the water to reach the restaurant.
            <br />
            <br />
            To get the full experience, the best time to go there is during the
            day for lunch. For dinner, it will usually be too dark to really see
            all the surroundings (and it gets dark quite early – around 6 pm).
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: Because of its popularity, the restaurant has pre-set seating
            times. You must book in advance and arrive to eat either at 12pm or
            2pm (for lunch).
            <br />
            <br />
            The Rock Zanzibar prices are a bit higher than some other
            restaurants in the area because of how unique the dining experience
            is. Expect to pay at least $60 USD per person for a proper lunch.

          <h3 className="section-head">9. VISIT PRISON ISLAND</h3>
          <p>
            This island is off the coast of Stone Town and is also known as
            Changuu island (don’t mix it up with Canggu in Bali!). Although
            Prison Island in Zanzibar seems like an intimidating name (and like
            it might not be a fun day trip!), it’s a bit of a misnomer. There
            never actually was a prison on the island. They used the island to
            house rebellious slaves in the 1860s and as a place to quarantine
            people with yellow fever.
            <br />
            <br />
            Nowadays, the island is a tourist destination because it is home to
            giant tortoises. It’s a peaceful sanctuary for this vulnerable
            species. Some people estimate some of the tortoises on the island
            are more than 150 years old!
            <br />
            <br />
            To get to Prison Island, you have to take a 25-minute boat ride from
            Stone Town. Most hotels can help you book a tour or you can head to
            the beach and look around for someone advertising one. If you want a
            more in-depth tour with a chance to snorkel, you can book a private
            tour! If you want a tour that takes you to all the sights in Stone
            Town and Prison Island all in one day, consider this tour instead.
            That way, you’ll get to see a bit of everything that Stone Town and
            Prison Island have to offer!
            <br />
            <br />
            The island is open every day from 9:00am to 4:15pm. You can plan to
            spend about 2-3 hours there during your visit (or longer, depending
            on the tour you’ve booked). The island does have a $4 USD entrance
            fee, which may be included with the cost of your tour (make sure to
            check or ask beforehand!)
          </p>
          <h3 className="section-head">
            10. TRY SNORKELING OR DIVING IN ZANZIBAR AT ONE OF THE ATOLLS
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you’re a fan of snorkeling or diving, there are some great places
            to do this in Zanzibar as well. Mnemba Atoll, located right off the
            north-east coast, is considered to be the best spot. You’ll see all
            sorts of colorful fish!
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: Divers, remember – you should have at least a 24-hour rest
            between your dive and your flight (for your safety!).
            <br />
            <br />
            If you’re near Mnemba (Kigomani or Matemwe beach village), you can
            hire a boat from someone right on the beach. This is the cheapest
            way to do it, but don’t expect luxury! These boats are not fancy and
            are about as simple as they come. Also, if you do it this way, don’t
            forget to bring your own snorkeling mask!
            <br />
            <br />
            PRO TIP: If you are into photography, you might want a waterproof
            camera or a GoPro to record everything you see around you!
            <br />
            <br />
            NOTE: Please do not touch the coral while diving or snorkeling. They
            are really sensitive and it takes years for them to regenerate if
            you disturb them. Treat the coral with respect. Remember, you are a
            guest there, so just look, don’t touch!
