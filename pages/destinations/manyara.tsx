                <h2>
                  Located on the way to Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti,
                  Lake Manyara National Park is worth a stop in its own right.
                  Its ground water forests, bush plains, baobab strewn cliffs,
                  and algae-streaked hot springs offer incredible ecological
                  variety in a small area, rich in wildlife and incredible
                  numbers of birds.

            In the shadow of the escarpment of the Great Rift Valley, Lake
            Manyara is best used as a soft introduction to a East Africa safari.
            While the scenic beauty of this park certainly makes it worth a
            visit, the game viewing here pales into insignificance when compared
            with that on offer in Tarangire, the Ngorongoro and the Serengeti.
            Famous for its tree-climbing lions, flamingos, breath-taking scenery
            and the soda-ash lake in the centre, Manyara merits a day trip but
            not much longer.

          <p>
            Lake Manyara is a lovely scenic park on the road from Arusha to the
            Ngorongoro Crater, famous for its tree-climbing lions, great
            birdlife, good elephants, and baboons. The lake itself takes up much
            of the park, leaving a strip of land running along its shores where
            game concentrates.<br/><br/> Often visited for an afternoon game drive on the
            way to Ngorongoro, it would be a shame to miss out Manyara if you’re
            driving straight past it – but it’s really not up there with the
            heavyweight big boys in terms of game viewing. However, if you’re
            going on to Ngorongoro and Serengeti, you’ll see plenty of game
            there anyway…

          <h3>Lake Manyara National Park: The Wildlife</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            The concentrations of game here is not nearly as high as in
            surrounding parks, but there are a number of unique species that
            give reason enough to safari here. The park’s main attraction is
            Lake Manyara’s famous tree-climbing lions – why these lions
            habitually climb trees is still up for debate, but viewing a pride
            relaxing in an acacia tree is a remarkable sight! The park is also
            famous for its elephant and a huge number of baboons, and its varied
            landscape supports an impressive range of other game including
            wildebeest, buffalo, hippo, flamingo, zebra, warthog, waterbuck,
            giraffe, dik-dik and impala. The birding here is also very good,
            especially raptors.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>How many flamingos are there on Lake Manyara?</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            Depending on when you go, flamingos flock on Lake Manyara in their
            thousands. It is impossible to predict as they flit between here and
            other East African lakes. You could see one, or you could see
            10,000… It really is down to the luck of the draw.
          </p>
          <h3>Lake Manyara – When to go</h3>{" "}
          <p>
            According to the regional migration pattern, Manyara’s official peak
            season is from July to October. However for such a small park this
            should not be a deciding factor; if you are in the area and have
            time, Lake Manyara is consistently good as a soft game viewing park
            at any time of the year. Lake Manyara is a great way to start your
            Tanzania safari and we recommend visiting on your Northern Tanzania
            circuit whilst on your way to the Ngorongoro Crater.
          </p>{" "}
          <h3>Lake Manyara – The activities</h3>
          <p>
            The main activity for visitor is day time game driving, although the
            park has recently started to offer night safaris and the camps deep
            inside the park offer short walks. Staying in the Rift Valley
            outside the park however does open up a wealth of possibilities,
            with activities such as walking, village trips, hiking and mountain
            biking available at some lodges.

            nearby Karatu area, the best of which are Plantation Lodge and Gibbs
