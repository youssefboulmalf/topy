            Planning a safari adventure to Tanzania and want to know a little
            more about the country? Not sure if you need to take malaria pills

            answers to all these questions and more with our Top Travel Tips
            covering everything from pre-travel health advice to money, shopping

          <h3>What vaccinations do I need for Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            You should seek medical advice from your local health practitioner
            before travelling to Tanzania and ensure that you receive all of the
            appropriate vaccinations. As a guide Polio, Diphtheria, Hepatitis A
            & B, Typhoid and Tetanus is strongly recommended. Meningitis and
            Rabies are also recommended.
            <br />
            <br />A Yellow Fever International Certificate of Vaccination is
            required if arriving from countries infected with yellow fever or if
            you were in transit through infected areas (unless you remained on
            board or at the airport). This is particularly relevant if
            travelling from neighbouring African countries. If visiting Zanzibar
            from mainland Tanzania, a yellow fever certificate must be produced
            to gain entry.
          </p>
          <h3>Do I need anti-malaria tablets for Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            There is a risk of malaria in Tanzania so it is very important to
            check with your doctor before you go, to see whether malarial
            medication is required for the areas you are visiting. Generally, it
            is good practice to avoid mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved,
            light-coloured clothes and wearing a mosquito repellent that
            contains at least 50% DEET. For more information on the malaria risk
            in Tanzania visit the NHS Fit to Travel page or the CDC Traveler’s
            Health page.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the plastic bag ban?</h3>
          <p>
            Tanzania has introduced a ban on plastic bags effective from June
            1st 2019. All travellers arriving at a Tanzania airport could face
            heavy fines for using plastic bags in any way, shape or form. These
            include shopping bags, garbage bags and “zip-lock” plastic bags used
            for transporting liquids and cosmetics.
            <br />
            <br />
            We recommend that you avoid packing any plastic bags in your
            suitcase or carry-on luggage before travelling to Tanzania. If you
            do purchase any items at your departure airport, be sure to take
            them out of their plastic bags. Double-check your hand luggage
            before disembarking and leave any plastic bags on the plane.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3>Is it safe to drink tap water in Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            The tap water in Tanzania is not considered safe to drink. You
            should drink bottled mineral water, which is readily available from
            shops, hotels and restaurants. Make sure you purchase this from
            reputable outlets and that the seal on the bottle is not broken.
          </p>
          <h3>What’s the food like in Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            The most common staples found in Tanzanian cuisine are rice and
            ugali, a thick, white paste made from cornmeal that is served
            alongside a sauce-based stew or meat dish. Chapatis, as can be found
            in India, also make the base of many meals along with beans and
            mchicha, a green vegetable that resembles spinach. Accompanying
            these staples are several different meat-centric dishes, such as
            grilled chicken or nyama choma, roasted beef or goat.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once you hit the coast, seafood makes more of an appearance and one
            delicious dish is octopus in a creamy coconut curry. Snacks are also
            widely available, a popular choice of which are samosas, brought
            over to Tanzania from India. Roasted corn with lemon and chilli salt
            is also a favourite with locals and can be bought from street-side
            grills. Meals can be washed down with a hot cup of chai tea or a
            local beer, such as Safari, Kilimanjaro or Castle.

          <h3>Safe eating while travelling in Tanzania</h3>
          <p>
            Be wary when eating outside of high-end lodges as sometimes the
            quality of the meat and the way in which it has been prepared might
            not be suitable for a sensitive western stomach. Also be aware that
            food hygiene in Tanzania is much more basic than you will be used to
            so if something looks unclean, old or badly cooked, it is best to
            avoid it altogether. It is also a good idea to avoid ice in your
            drink and eating salad as these might have come into contact with
            unhygienic water.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3>Is it standard to tip in Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            There is no set procedure when it comes to tipping in Tanzania but
            be aware that most people in the service industry earn very little
            and depend on gratuities to make up their income. Safari guides
            should be tipped the equivalent of about USD $10-15 per day and a
            few dollars should go to the driver, cook and porters when
            travelling on an overland safari. If you eat in a restaurant then
            10% on top of the bill is a suitable amount to leave. When it comes
            to taxis, rounding up the fare is a nice way to show your
            appreciation, especially if they have successfully navigated the
            chaotic streets of Dar es Salaam for you.
          </p>
          <h3>What is good to shop for in Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            Be wary when eating outside of high-end lodges as sometimes the

          <h3>Safe eating while travelling in Tanzania</h3>
          <p>
            The most popular purchase for travellers in Tanzania is a
            traditional wooden carving, usually in the shape of a mask or tribes
            person. A close second to this are the soapstone sculptures that can
            be found in boutiques as well as marketplaces. Another excellent
            item to take home with you is a Maasai blanket, which are brightly
            coloured and similar in pattern to tartan and can be used as
            tablecloths, picnic blankets or even clothes.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you’re looking for something to wear, colourful kangas, which
            look like sarongs, are widely available. You might also want to look
            out for some tinga-tinga art, a unique style to Tanzania that
            encompasses bright colours and a cartoon-ish style and usually
            depicts safari animals or African scenes. Another uniquely Tanzanian
            product is Tanzanite, a deep blue precious gem that can only be
            found in the country. If you want to buy one of these stones it is a
            good idea to do your research beforehand or take a trustworthy and
            knowledgeable guide who can make sure you’re getting the real deal.

          <h3>Is bargaining acceptable in Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            Bargaining in Tanzania is not just acceptable but it is expected and
            you will find that as a tourist you will be told a much higher price
            than a local would be offered. Don’t let this annoy or offend you as
            chances are you have more money in your wallet than most of the
            other people in the market will see in a month or even a year. Don’t
            let yourself be ripped off but also be prepared to pay slightly over
            the odds for something.
          </p>
          <h3>Is it safe for a single woman to travel to Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            A lot of travellers visit Tanzania as part of a safari tour and in
            this context, visiting Tanzania is very safe for solo women as they
            will be away from crowded cities and under the protection of their
            guide and lodge at all times. However, those who visit Tanzania
            independently might have a slightly different experience. Harassment
            from local men is common but is usually just an annoyance rather
            than a threat. Nevertheless, you will want to avoid this by dressing
            conservatively, wearing sunglasses to avoid eye contact and carrying
            a photo of a man in your purse who you can say is your husband. You
            should also try to limit your night time travel as much as possible.
          </p>
          <h3>How about as a member of the LGBT community?</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, homosexuality is illegal in Tanzania, and sexual activity
            with someone of the same gender is punishable with prison,
            especially for males. Whilst an outdated view, this does not mean
            that Tanzanians are inhospitable or unfriendly people. In fact,
            Tanzania is generally a very welcoming country, homosexuality is
            just not accepted like it is in other parts of the world today.
            <br />
            <br />
            Any LGBT traveller wishing to explore Tanzania would be best to
            behave with discretion and not to engage in any flirting or sexual
            activity with anyone of the same sex whilst visiting the country. As
            long as travellers act with discretion, there is no reason to expect
            any problems.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the duty-free allowance for Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            Travellers over 17 are permitted to bring the following into
            Tanzania:
            <br />
            <br />
            250g of cigarettes, cigars and tobacco (combined weight)
            <br />
            <br />
            1 litre of spirits or wine
            <br />
            <br />
            500ml of perfume and eau de toilette, of which no more than a
            quarter may be perfume
            <br />
            <br />
            Unlicensed firearms and ammunition are banned from being imported
            into Tanzania.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the currency in Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            The official currency in Tanzania is the Tanzania Shilling. Check
            OANDA for the latest exchange rates.
            <br />
            <br />
            Euro, British Pounds, US Dollars, South African Rand and other major
            currencies can be exchanged locally or in advance of departure.
            Additionally, exchange facilities are available at various bureau de
            changes and banks in major towns have ATMs. It’s advisable to
            request bank notes in smaller denominations, as it can sometimes be
            hard to get change from large notes and smaller notes are handy for
            smaller purchases and gratuities.
            <br />
            <br />
            Traveller’s Cheques are not recommended as they’re often difficult
            to exchange and incur high fees.
          </p>
          <h3>What do things cost in Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            Generally, those on safari will have their accommodation and food
            costs included in their tour package. However, those heading to the
            big cities should expect to pay around USD $50 per night for
            mid-range hotels and around USD $100 for the best accommodation
            options. Street food is widely available and costs anything from a
            few cents to USD $3 depending on how hungry you are. A sit-down meal
            with a beer can cost up to around USD $10. Public transport is cheap
            and long bus journeys can come in at as little as a few dollars.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What sort of plugs do I need for Tanzania and what is the voltage?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The standard voltage is 230 – 240 volts. Primary sockets generally
            require the 3 square-pin variety, similar to the United Kingdom
            sockets. We recommend that you pack a universal travel adaptor. You
            will need a voltage converter and plug adaptor in order to use U.S.
            appliances.
          </p>
          <h3>Is WiFi widely available in Tanzania?</h3>
          <p>
            WiFi is common in Tanzania’s main cities but be aware that
            connections can be slower and less secure than you might be used to
            back home. In the national parks there is very rarely a WiFi
            connection as guests are encouraged to disconnect and immerse
            themselves in nature.
          </p>
          <h3>What time zone is Tanzania in?</h3>
          <p>
            Tanzania is 3 hours ahead of GMT and does not observe daylight
            savings.
          </p>
          <h3>Travelling with Children</h3>
          <p>
            In Africa selected departures of our overland safaris are classified
            as ‘Family Friendly’ and these are noted under ‘Prices and Dates’ on
            the relevant tours. Family Friendly departures welcome children aged
            6 – 17 years travelling with their parents on tour. Please note
            children will be occupying a seat on the overland truck, therefore
            they pay full price. Parents must be aware that travellers aged 18
            years and older still frequent the trip and the tour is a
            participation overland tour. Children aged eight and above
            travelling with a parent or guardian are also welcome on lodge
            safaris in Tanzania on a request basis and subject to the agreement
            of the other passengers. Please note that children aged 12+ pay
            adult price. We can tailor-make private safaris for families and
            those travelling with younger children.
