              <h1>10 Things I Wish I’d Known Before My Tanzania Safari</h1>
              <h2>
                Things to Know Before Traveling to Tanzania. “If travel is like
                love, it is, in the end, mostly because it's a heightened state
                of awareness, ..

            Planning a safari conjures up images of stunning landscapes,
            spectacular animals, and luxurious lodgings set amidst pristine
            landscapes. Alas, it also conjures up some very expensive price
            tags. This was the exact dilemma I faced while planning my trip to
            Tanzania. Faced with a seemingly impossible dilemma, I dived into
            research and discovered camping safaris.
          </span>
          <h3>1. You Don’t Need Camping Gear. At Least, Not Much</h3>
          <p>
            Most camping safari outfitters include tents, camping chairs, all
            food and cooking supplies, and even mattress pads. You have the
            option of renting a sleeping bag, but I took my own — and I’m glad I
            did. I was just more comfortable having something that was never
            used by anyone else. I bought a very small, very lightweight
            sleeping bag for about $30 back home. It only took up a small corner
            of my bag. At the end of my trip, I asked my guides if I could give
            it to them and have them donate it to someone in need, and they were
            thrilled to do so.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Relax. You Will See Animals</h3>
          <p>
            Luxury lodges have their own airstrips but camping safaris have a
            whole lot of dusty driving and not much in the way of wildlife
            before you reach your initial destination. Whatever you do, don’t
            think of this as wasted time. Take the time to get to know your
            guides and pepper them with questions about the plants, flowers,
            trees, and birds. Their knowledge is extraordinary, and they’ll
            likely have field guides you can borrow to read up on all that
            you’re seeing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before you know it, you’ll be seeing animals. Lots of animals.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Don’t Get Too Hung Up On The Big Five</h3>
          <p>
            The lion, leopard, elephant, Cape buffalo, and rhinoceros make up
            the “Big Five” — the ultimate safari bucket list. And while it’s fun
            to have a list, some folks take it a bit too far. I’ve seen guests
            who considered their adventure a failure because they didn’t see all
            Big Five on the trip. Your chances of seeing the Big Five (or not)
            on a camping safari are the same as any other kind of trip.
            <br />
            <br />
            Speaking of the Big Five … in all my years of travel, I’ve never
            seen a leopard. But at least one leopard has seen me, and it’s all
            thanks to camping. Urgent bathroom needs convinced me to sneak out
            of my tent one night — just for a minute! — to quickly pee. The next
            morning, our guide pointed out the fresh, feathery remains of guinea
            fowl and reported that a leopard had spent the night just steps from
            our tent, enjoying his snack. After that report, I learned to hold
            it!
          </p>
          <h3>4. Camping Means Close-Ups</h3>
          <p>
            While not every safari participant has the opportunity to see a
            leopard, there’s no denying that this way of travel allows you to
            get up close and personal with the wildlife. On one memorable
            occasion, we awoke to see a firm path of deep, intimidating lion
            footprints — the pathmaker had meandered directly through our site
            just hours earlier. On another occasion, a hyena lay on its belly
            and watched us, from a safe distance, as we finished our evening
            meal. Birds loved visiting us as we set up camp. And because we
            stayed in the heart of Serengeti National Park, the minute we got in
            the jeep, we saw big animals.

          <h3>6. Camping Food Is Impressive</h3>
          <p>
            If you think camping cuisine means beans and wieners, you’re going
            to be mightily impressed on a camping safari. We enjoyed fresh bread
            every morning, baked in the embers of last night’s fire. Dinners
            included chicken curry, stir fry with noodles, and a South
            African-style braai feast of sausages, steak, and more. We enjoyed
            desserts and sophisticated salads like beet and feta and, overall, I
            was thrilled with the food and the portions.

          <h3>7. The Coffee Is Not</h3>
          <p>
            My only food-related complaints applied to coffee and tea. The
            instant coffee available at breakfast and break time left much to be
            desired. I suddenly realized just what a coffee snob I am! I had
            some coffeeshop brand instant coffee and latte mix with me, and it
            offered a welcomed change. Tea drinkers will want to note that just
            one kind of black tea is usually available. If you love tea, a box
            of assorted flavors would be a welcome treat for the entire group.

          <h3>7. The Coffee Is Not</h3>
          <p>
          Some camping safaris offer deluxe tents (which are set up for you as you’re enjoying an evening game ride), spacious outdoor showers, and some extra comforts. But the most hands-on and affordable experience is a participatory camping safari. “Participatory” is just a fancy way of saying you’ll be helping out with the chores. Turns out, they’re pretty easy. You’ll assist as the guides set up your tents, you’ll help unload folding chairs and tables from the truck, and you’ll lend a helping hand when the canvas frames of the shower and toilet are being installed. You truly need no camping skills, just a willingness to help out.

          <h3>9. Think Twice About Your Safari Wardrobe</h3>
          <p>
          You’ll dress much differently for a camping safari than you would a lodge trip. Cool, casual clothing is paramount for your comfort. I’m glad I brought thin, loose, comfortable trousers made from quick-dry material. I even slept in them some nights! I was especially thrilled with my choice when it came to the awkward climb in and out of the safari vehicle. I was equally happy that I brought along a classic Tilley hat, a lightweight long-sleeved shirt (for layering against the early morning chill), and a somewhat stereotypical “safari” shirt. While I never put the endless pockets to use, it was incredibly lightweight and dried in an instant.
<br/><br/>
Far less comfortable were the athletic-style tops that promised to wick away moisture and keep me cooler than a regular cotton shirt. They just clung to my body and didn’t allow for any fresh-air circulation. All. Day. Long. If I could do it all over again, I’d swap them out for extra safari shirts and regular everyday t-shirts.
          </p>
          <h3>10. Camping Showers Are Awesome (And A Bit Awkward)</h3>
          <p>
          I’m not sure a shower has ever felt so refreshing as the one I enjoyed after two days of safari adventures. Thanks to my clingy wardrobe of athletic fabrics, I was overheated, horribly sweaty, and dust clung to me like that was its job. Our camp shower consisted of a simple four-sided canvas shelter with a flap of fabric for a door. A perforated rubber mat was comfortable underfoot and ensured you didn’t stand in the mud. A folding chair just outside the fabric flap was convenient for storing towels and supplies, while a cone-shaped bucket with a showerhead nozzle hung from the tree overhead and provided a surprisingly strong stream of water. A quick scrub never felt so good! But wriggling in and out of my vexing wardrobe was an exercise in frustration! Yet another reason to bring a few things that are loose and breezy.

          <h3>Pro Tips: When To Visit And Additional Safari Advice</h3>
          <p>
          Serengeti National Park is gorgeous all year round but would-be visitors should note that the dry season typically runs from July to October and the rainy season goes from April to May. Game viewing is considered best between late May and November, but in April and early May, the lush grass is thick and long after months of ample water. As such, animals have superb camouflage and game viewing is more challenging.
