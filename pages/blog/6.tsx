              <h2>
                There really is no right or wrong time to visit this well-loved
                country but as a rule of thumb, the dry season (from late June
                to October) is the most popular time for a Tanzania safari with
                all the trimmings.

            The best time to visit Tanzania is during the Dry season, from late
            June to October, when wildlife viewing is generally at its best. The
            wildebeest migration in the Serengeti is usually during June and
            July and the time to see the wildebeest calving is late January to
            February. The southern and western circuit parks are best visited
            during the Dry season (June to October), unlike the more popular
            northern circuit parks that can be visited year-round.

          <h3>Dry Season (June – October)</h3>
          <br />
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              June and July are the best months to see the wildebeest migration
            </li>
            <li>
              August to September is the best time to see the wildebeest river
              crossings in northern Serengeti
            </li>
            <li>
              Animals are easier to spot since they concentrate around
              waterholes and rivers
            </li>
            <li>
              There are fewer mosquitoes because there is little to no rain
            </li>
            <li>Skies are clear and most days are sunny</li>
            <li>
              Mornings and nights get cold; it’s recommended to bring warm
              clothing
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Wet Season (November to May)</h3>
          <br />
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              January-February is the time to see the calving in the southern
              Serengeti, and an excellent time to see predator action
            </li>
            <li>
              The scenery is green and beautiful; it’s low season, meaning lower
              rates and less crowded parks
            </li>
            <li>
              Although wildlife is easier to spot in the Dry season, you’ll
              still see plenty, especially in the northern circuit parks
            </li>
            <li>
              Migratory birds are present, and bird watching is at its best
            </li>
            <li>
              Except for March, April and May, rains are mostly short afternoon
              showers and seldom interfere on your trip
            </li>
            <li>March to May is the peak of the Wet season</li>
            <li>
              Wildlife viewing in Tarangire, Katavi, Selous and Ruaha is better
              during the Dry season
            </li>
